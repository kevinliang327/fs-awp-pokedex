# FullStack Academy Async Week Project - Pokédex Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Description

This is a Pokédex progressive web app (PWA) that displays information on Gen I Pokémon from the Kanto region. It explores visual technologies and simple PWA creation. It utilizes Bootstrap to create a clean and customizable user interface that seamlessly adjusts for different screen sizes. AOS enhances the user experience with scrolling animations.

PWAs are web apps that create experiences indistinguishable from native apps using service workers and manifests. Service workers are specialized JavaScript scripts that run in the background and act as proxies between web browsers and web servers. They aim to improve reliability by providing offline access through cached information and boost page performance by enabling features such as push notifications and background syncs. Workbox is a library that simplifies common service worker implementation and caching.

## Future Work

- Addition of more detailed data to explore other visual technologies such as Chart.js and D3.js
- Exploration of offline experience
- Addition of an evolution tree component displayed on the single Pokémon view that allows for navigation
- Implementation of ID/name searching on the home page
- Implementation of pagination and filtering
- Addition of other generation Pokémon - Gotta catch 'em all!
